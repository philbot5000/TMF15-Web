## Usage

**Step 1:** If you do not have nodejs, [install](https://nodejs.org) it from the node.js website.

**Step 2:** (Optional Mac only) It's generally a good idea to make sure your `/usr/local` has the correct permissions. `sudo chown -R $USER:admin /usr/local`

**Step 3:** Clone https://github.com/philbot5000/TMF15-Web.git to your desktop or type `git clone https://github.com/philbot5000/TMF15-Web.git TMF15` in the directory you wish the repository to live.

**Step 4:** Change directories into the repo and run `npm install` to get all the modules for this project.

**Step 5:** Run `bower install` to grab all the front-end dependancies. Run `npm install -g bower` if you don't have [Bower](http://bower.io/).

**Step 6:** Finally run `grunt serve` and wait for the boilerplate project to open on http://127.0.0.1:9000/ in your browser of choice. If you don't have [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) then run `npm install -g grunt` and `npm install -g grunt-cli`.
